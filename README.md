Coding this website allowed me to improve my skills with Tailwind CSS, and more importantly, it helped me learn about Framer Motion and creating reusable variants for different animations. I chose to create a landing page because I wanted to learn more about best practices for its design. Framer Motion is an incredibly user-friendly coding extension, and I plan to use it in every project I can in the future.
